title: "Reproducibility example with FLR and renv"
output: github_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an example document to show how the R package `renv` can be used to create a reproducible FLR script.

## Start using `renv`

For this example to work, the R package `renv` needs to be installed first. `renv` is available from CRAN.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("renv")
```

## Clone repository

The easiest way to run this example, is to clone this GitHub repository. This can be done by clicking on the green "Code" button above (see screenshot), and clone the repository with the address in an environment of your choice, with GitHub Desktop or by downloading the content as a zip file.

## Install FLR packages

Because we are working with FLR packages, these need to be build from source. This will require tools for compiling these. These tools need to be installled before we can install the FLR packages. On Windows, this requires Rtools https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools40.html.

The `renv` package can create snapshots of all used R packages, including their dependencies. The record is stored in the [`renv.lock`](https://github.com/shfischer/FLR_renv_example/blob/main/renv.lock) file, which includes the exact package version and the source from where the packages can be installed. The list of packages is quite extensive because it also includes the packages required to compile the other FLR packages. `renv` creates a local R package library (e.g. in renv/library/R-4.1/x86_64-w64-mingw32) where it stores the R packages.

More details about `renv` can be found at https://rstudio.github.io/renv/.

Once the repository has been cloned, we can install (restore) all R packages defined in [`renv.lock`](https://github.com/shfischer/FLR_renv_example/blob/main/renv.lock) with one command and following the interactive installer.

```{r eval=FALSE}
renv::restore()
```
```
This project has not yet been activated.
Activating this project will ensure the project library is used during restore.
Please see `?renv::activate` for more details.

Would you like to activate this project before restore? [Y/n]:
```
Activate the project when asked (type "y" and press Enter):

After that, there will be list of all the R package to be installed:
```
* Project 'FLR_renv_example_test' loaded. [renv 0.15.0]
* The project library is out of sync with the lockfile.
* Use `renv::restore()` to install packages recorded in the lockfile.
The following package(s) will be updated:

Consider restarting the R session and loading the newly-installed packages.


Restarting R session...

* Project 'FLR_renv_example_test' loaded. [renv 0.15.0]
```

If R packages already exist in the global R library, they will simply be copied into the local project library.

This completes the R package installation.

## A reproducible example

After the installation, it is possible to run the [example code](https://github.com/shfischer/FLR_renv_example/blob/main/script_example.md)
